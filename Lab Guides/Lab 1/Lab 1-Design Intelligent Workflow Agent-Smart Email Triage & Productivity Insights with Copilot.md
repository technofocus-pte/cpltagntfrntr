# Design Intelligent Workflow Agent: Smart Email Triage & Productivity Insights with Copilot

## **Lab objectives** 

This lab introduces the Workflows Agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot as an
AI-powered orchestration engine that goes beyond traditional automation.
Instead of building static workflows, you will design intelligent,
adaptive workflows (agents) that can plan, execute, and improve tasks
using natural language. In this lab, you will build an Intelligent Email
Triage Agent for Zava Retail that:

- Runs every weekday morning

- Reviews unread emails (last 24 hours)

- Identifies urgent/actionable emails

- Categorizes emails intelligently

- Generates summaries + next steps

- Sends structured output to Microsoft Teams

- Uses Work IQ to provide productivity insights

## **Scenario** 

Zava Retail, a rapidly growing omnichannel retailer, faced increasing
operational complexity due to high volumes of communication across
customers, suppliers, and internal teams. With expansion across
e-commerce platform, 50+ physical stores, vendor and supplier ecosystem,
customer support and marketing teams, email became the primary but
inefficient channel for critical business interactions. Zava Retail
teams receive hundreds of emails daily from:

- Customers (complaints, returns, inquiries)

- Suppliers (inventory updates, delays)

- Internal teams (approvals, escalations)

This results in:

- Missed urgent emails

- Slow response times

- Employee burnout due to overload

- Lack of visibility into priorities

To address this challenge, Zava Retail is looking to implement an
AI-powered Intelligent Workflow Agent using Microsoft 365 Copilot to
automate email triage, highlight urgent and actionable items, deliver
insights to workload and productivity, and provide real-time
productivity insights.

## **Key Personas**

1.  **Marie Brown – Customer Support Manager**

The customer support manager at Zava Retail manages the customer support
inbox, handles escalations and SLA (Service-level agreement) compliance,
and coordinates with logistics and SLA compliance.

2.  **David Turner – Supply Chain Coordinator**

The supply chain coordinator at Zava Retail tracks vendor
communications, manages inventory updates and delays, and coordinates
with warehouses.

3.  **Patricia Gray – Operations Head**

The operations head at Zava Retail oversees the business operations
across departments, tracks productivity and workload, and ensures
operational efficiency.

## Lab Prerequisites

**Licensing & Access**

### Task 2: Describe the Workflow in Natural Language

1.  Define Business Logic (Prompt), Paste the below prompt and click **Send**.

    ```
    Each weekday morning, review unread emails from the last 24 hours.  
    Focus on:  
    - Customer complaints and escalations  
    - Supplier/vendor updates  
    - Internal approvals or urgent requests
      
    Categorize emails into:*
    
    - *Urgent – Needs immediate action*
    
    - *Action Required – Needs response*
    
    - *FYI – Informational*
    
    *For each email include:  
    - Sender  
    - Subject  
    - Summary  
    - Any deadlines  
    - Suggested next steps  
      
    Highlight:  
    - Customer complaints impacting SLA  
    - Supplier delays affecting inventory  
      
    Send the structured summary to myself on Microsoft Teams email id -
    @lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Username.
    ```

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/cpltagntfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%201/media/image11.png)

2.  Select **Save** on the top right corner of the **Workflow** window
    to run the actions automatically. Your workflow is now created and
    ready to test.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/cpltagntfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%201/media/image12.png)

3.  Once the workflow is saved, select **Test** to review the output.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/cpltagntfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%201/media/image13.png)

4.  Once the testing is successful, it will show the test duration and
    result as success confirmation.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/cpltagntfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%201/media/image14.png)

Once the test process is completed, review that it:

- Creates scheduled trigger (weekday mornings)

- Connects to:

  - Outlook (email ingestion)

  - Dataverse AI (reasoning)

  - Teams (output delivery)

- Applies AI reasoning for categorization and summarization.

You did not configure connectors manually—Copilot did it.

>[!Note] Test process can take 5-10 minutes. Wait until the process
is completed.

### Task 3: Validate Output 

After processing your prompt, you will see the run results:

1. Emails detected.

    >[!Note] You need to send different types of sample emails to the
    account to verify that the workflow triggers a notification in Microsoft
    Teams. If you do not have any new unread emails in your inbox, you will
    need to do send test emails to validate the workflow and outputs.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/cpltagntfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%201/media/image15.png)

2.  Email categorization accuracy.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/cpltagntfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%201/media/image16.png)

3.  Teams message format.

    Ensure that the Teams message format is matching the Outlook email
    details.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/cpltagntfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%201/media/image18.png)

4.  If something looks wrong:

    - Update the prompt
    
    - Re-test

5.  Check for the following test results for Zava Retail.

    - Are customer complaints in urgent?
    
    - Are supplier delays highlighted?
    
    - Are summaries actionable?
    
    - Is Teams message structured clearly?

## **Lab Summary**

In this lab, you learned how the Workflows Agent in Microsoft 365
Copilot enables a shift from static automation to AI-powered, adaptive
workflows. Instead of predefined rules, you built an intelligent agent
that understands context, makes decisions, and improves over time.

You created an Email Triage Agent for Zava Retail that runs every
weekday, reviews recent unread emails, identifies urgent items,
categorizes messages, generates summaries with next steps, and shares
structured outputs in Microsoft Teams. It also uses Work IQ to provide
productivity insights.

As a result, Zava Retail reduced email overload, improved response
times, automated task handling, and minimized missed escalations while
demonstrating how AI-driven agents can enhance operational efficiency
and decision-making.
